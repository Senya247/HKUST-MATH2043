## MATH2043 HKUST
This repo contains content on the course "Honors Mathematical Analysis", course code MATH2043 at HKUST for Spring 25-26. Create an issue if you require lecture videos.

Homework is written in Typst.
```bash
cd HW && typst compile HW*.typ
```

I will not upload the solutions manual for Advanced Analysis since the homework is just questions from it. Do it yourself.
